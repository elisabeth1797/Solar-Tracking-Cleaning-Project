Solar-Tracking and Self-Cleaning Solar Panel Project
The Solar Panel Project aims to be a self-sustainable system that consists of dual axis motion for solar tracking, a self-cleaning mechanism, and an app for data.The objective is to determine whether the addition of the self-cleaning mechanism and solar tracking improves the amount of energy acquired. Two linear actuators will be used to allow a dual axis motion. The system will be controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. Energy being obtained by the panel will be displayed on the app. This will allow the user to monitor how much energy is obtained by the panel at different times of the day and the benefits of the cleaning mechanism and solar tracking.
